\section{Introduction}
In the following report we present our solution for parallel merging â€“ using the programming frameworks
Cilk,
OpenMP
and MPI.
Two given ordered arrays of length $m$ and $n$ are merged in a resulting array which is ordered again.
In order to do this in parallel, the task of merging must somehow be distributed among several instances.
This causes differences for each of the technologies mentioned above.
But there are also some general ideas that could be used for all solutions.

So we are going to show how we approached this problem in general.
Then we go into details of the differences and we present how the problem was be implemented for each solution.

An other interesting aspect is performance.
What is the result of parallelization?
Where are the differences between our solutions?
These questions are answered in the last sections.
There we demonstrate how our solutions behave for several input sizes and on different amounts of used processes/threads.
